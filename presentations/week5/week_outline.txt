One-Sentence Overview:
Turn embedded edgelists into features.


Deliverables:
1. Tensor of distances
    - defined as T_{i,j,k=node} =  ||\vec{G_i}(k)  - \vec{G_j}(k)||, were G_i is the embedding of the i-th edgelist


Pseudocode:
    - How to generate distance tensor
        for node:
          for 


Questions to answer:
    1. What do the axes of the struc2vec embedding mean?
    2. How would you describe the space


Interesting things to look at:
    1. Read SMART goals to help define a DoD
        - Key point: "measurable"
            * How can you measure the level of contribution a tensor decomp makes?
                - Cluster extracted features (not a quantitative measurement)
                -
