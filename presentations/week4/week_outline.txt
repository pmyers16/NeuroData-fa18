One-Sentence Overview:
Find more ways for doing feature extraction and evaluate those features.


Deliverables:
1. Three more methods for getting features from graphs
    - Centrality
    - A vector of scalar features (calculated from networkx)
    - https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/graphrepresentation-ieee17.pdf
2. Use LASSO (or other feature selection method) to see which methods are giving the best features
3. Plot of feature matrices in 2-space
    - Dim reduce using PCA, NMF, or t-SNE


Some interesting things I saw:
    - Omnibus embedding
        * Plots graphs in 2-space?
        * Run omni on a Laplacian
    - Adjacency spectral embedding?
