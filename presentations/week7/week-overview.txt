Week 7
October 11, 2018 - October 17, 2018

Week 6 recap:
  - Read paper on scan statistics: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10588-005-5378-z
    - Basic idea of scan statistics:
      - Get all vertices in the k-hop neighborhood of a vertex u
      - Compute a statistic on the induced subgraph
        - The statistic I calculated was k-locality:
          - Defined as the cardinality of the edge set of the subgraph of vertex u
      - A scan statistic is the statistic that is calculated across all vertices in the graph

  - Implemented scan statistics in Python (networkx)
  - Made embedding of graph that maps each vertex to its (1-locality, 2-locality)


Week 7 Goals:
  - Turn the multiple embeddings into feature matrix
  - Sum edge weights to get weighted k-locality

  - Run clustering on the data
  - Get labels for age and sex
    - Clustering on sex
    - Regression on age

Things to ask jovo:
  - Are the edge weights in the HBN data consistent across graphs (i.e. does an edge weight of 2000 mean the same thing in two different patients)?
    - Weights are counts of number of fibers between one region and another
    - You can't calibrate this metric though
      - Jovo recommends using pass-to-ranks on the graph
        - Mitigates the batch effect across patients

  - What are the patient privacy rules for this data?


Jovo's comments:
  - The pipeline for generating features might belong in ndmg
  - "Group level analysis"
  - Sprint 1 DoD: PR into ndmg for doing group level analysis
