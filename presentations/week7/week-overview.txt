Week 7
October 11, 2018 - October 17, 2018

Week 6 recap:
  - Read paper on scan statistics: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10588-005-5378-z
    - Basic idea of scan statistics:
      - Get all vertices in the k-hop neighborhood of a vertex u
      - Compute a statistic on the induced subgraph
        - The statistic I calculated was k-locality:
          - Defined as the cardinality of the edge set of the subgraph of vertex u
      - A scan statistic is the statistic that is calculated across all vertices in the graph

  - Implemented scan statistics in Python (networkx)
  - Made embedding of graph that maps each vertex to its (1-locality, 2-locality)


Week 7 Goals:
  - Turn the multiple embeddings into feature matrix
  - Run clustering on the data
  - Get labels for age and sex
    - Clustering on sex
    - Regression on age
